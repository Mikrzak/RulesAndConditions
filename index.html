    <title>Comment Battle Royale RULES</title>

<body>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'; font-size: 30px;">How do I participate?</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">By writing a comment under my newest TikTok you are guaranteed to take part in the next battle royale game (unless you write a comment during the time window when I'm making a new video or put the special character at the end).</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'; font-size: 30px; color: red;">WARNING: This means that your profile name and profile picture will be visible on screen in the next video!<br>If you don't want this to happen, read the info below:</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'; font-size: 30px;">What if I want to write a comment but don't want to take part in the game?</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">You can put a "^" sign (without the quotes) at the end of your comment and you won't be included in the next game.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'; font-size: 30px;">How does this game work exactly?</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">The game concept is really simple and you probably have figured it out already if you have watched my previous TikToks, but here are the game rules in detail:</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">Every comment gets turned into a cube that's bouncing around on the screen - it consists of the profile picture and the profile name as well as the number of lives a player has.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">The number of lives is calculated using this formula: <b>3*sqrt(comment_likes) + 3</b> (this might be changed later if it's unbalanced. It's not linear to make the game a little bit more fair).</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">If one cube bounces into another cube and they both have more than 1 life, their lives get subtracted by 1 and the both bounce (their velocity vectors get inverted and switched around).</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">If one cube bounces into another cube and they both have 1 life, they both disappear.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">If one cube bounces into another cube and the second cube only has 1 life, the second cube disappears and the first cube doesn't lose any lives (steals it from the other cube) and also doesn't bounce.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">Every player has the same speed, only the direction of the velocity vector is different. This speed gradually increases as the game progesses.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">Every player has an attack/damage cooldown of 100 ms.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">The profile names of the top 3 players (or maybe more than 3 in the future) get displayed at the end.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'; font-size: 30px;">Additional info:</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">Writing more than 1 comment won't add clones of yourself to the game!!!</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">This game is made using p5.js which is a great library but I probably should have used Processing to make the simulation a little bit faster. I used Python and Selenium to collect the comments, might share the code some day.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Helvetica'">I don't know how many players it can handle and the sounds will get really glitchy too XD</p>
